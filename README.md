# AGK Language Compiler

A revolutionary compiler that combines the best features of C++, Java, and Python with natural language syntax.

## Vision

AGK (pronounced "awk") is a programming language that aims to be:
- **Powerful**: Combines performance of C++, safety of Java, and expressiveness of Python
- **Natural**: Uses English-like syntax that's intuitive to read and write
- **Modern**: Supports contemporary programming paradigms and best practices

## Target Language Features

### From Python
- Simple, clean syntax
- Dynamic typing with optional type hints
- List comprehensions and generator expressions
- Decorators and context managers
- Duck typing philosophy

### From Java
- Strong static typing system
- Interface-based programming
- Exception handling with checked exceptions
- Package/namespace system
- Automatic memory management

### From C++
- Template metaprogramming
- Operator overloading
- Multiple inheritance
- Performance optimizations
- Low-level system access (when needed)

## Natural Language Syntax Examples

Instead of:
```python
def calculate_total(items):
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        total += item
    return total
```

You would write:
```
define function calculate_total that takes items:
    create total as 0
    for each item in items:
        add item to total
    return total
```

Instead of:
```java
public class Person implements Serializable {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}
```

You would write:
```
define class Person that implements Serializable:
    private name as String
    private age as Integer

    define constructor that takes name as String, age as Integer:
        set this name to name
        set this age to age

    define function get_name that returns String:
        return this name
```

## Architecture

The compiler consists of several key components:
1. **Natural Language Lexer**: Tokenizes English-like syntax
2. **Natural Language Parser**: Parses tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree
3. **Semantic Analyzer**: Performs type checking and validation
4. **Code Generator**: Generates optimized target code
5. **Symbol Table**: Manages variables, functions, and types
6. **Error Reporter**: Provides clear, helpful error messages
